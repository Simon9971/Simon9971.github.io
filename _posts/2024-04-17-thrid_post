# Basic introduction about Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training and utilizing neural networks to model and understand complex patterns and relationships in data. It is characterized by the use of large neural networks with many layers of processing units, hence the term "deep." These models are capable of learning rich and sophisticated representations of data, making them highly effective for a wide range of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

Deep learning models are typically trained using a large amount of labeled data and substantial computing power. They automatically extract features from raw data through multiple layers of the network, where each layer builds on the features recognized in the previous layer. This hierarchical feature extraction process allows deep learning models to handle very complex and high-dimensional data, which is difficult for traditional machine learning approaches.

The success of deep learning in recent years has been driven by advances in computing power (such as GPUs), the availability of large datasets, and improvements in algorithms and network architectures, making it a key technology in many AI applications today.
